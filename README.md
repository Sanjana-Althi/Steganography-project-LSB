# Steganography-project-LSB

Steganography: Hiding Information in Images 🖼️🔒
Project Description:
This project focuses on implementing LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography for hiding and extracting information in digital images. Using a random image as the carrier, the project employs encryption and decryption techniques to securely embed and retrieve hidden data. The primary goal is to explore how image processing and data security can be combined to ensure confidential communication. 🔐💬

Technologies Used 🛠️
* Python 🐍: The primary programming language used to implement the project.

* NumPy 🔢: A library for numerical computing, used for efficient image data manipulation.

* OpenCV (cv2) 👁️‍🗨️: An open-source computer vision library, utilized to load and manipulate images.

Features 🌟
* LSB Steganography: Hides information in the least significant bits of the image pixels. 

* Encryption & Decryption: Encrypts the hidden message and decrypts it when needed. 

* Random Image Selection: A random image is selected as the carrier to embed the hidden data.
  
  Usage 💻
Hiding Information:
To hide a message in an image, run the program and input the text you want to encrypt and embed into the selected image. The message is then securely hidden using LSB encoding. 📝🔒

Extracting Information:
To extract the hidden message from an image, the program decrypts the encoded data and displays the original message. 📜🕵️‍♂️
